# Definitions of Probability

### Classical

$P (A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$

### Relative frequency

$$\lim_{n(S) \to \infty} \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$

### Axiomatic

Three axioms

Say, S is sample space and A is an event 

- $0 \le P (A) \le 1$ <span style="color: red;">(NOT $P(A) \ge 0$)</span>
- At least one of S will occur. P (S) = 1; Certain event. 
- $P(A_1 U A_2 U ... U A_n)=P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n)$ or  
- $$P\left(\cup _{i=1}^{\infty }E_{i}\right)=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }P(E_{i})$$

### Permutaion vs Combination

Suppose, we have three letters: A, B, and C. If we are told to take two of them and arrange them in as many ways as possible, we could write:

AB
BA
AC
CA
BC
CA

We can arrange them in 6 different ways. Here, AB and BA are different arrangements. 

Consider a row of a train with two seats. 

There are 15 cricketers in BD preliminary team. We got to <span style="font-style:italic; color:blue;">select </span> 11. C or P?
